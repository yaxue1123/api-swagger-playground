# API Playground (Swagger)

This repository provides a simple REST API with a Swagger (OpenAPI) interface.
It is used to help students explore URLs, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH), and REST
concepts by interacting with live endpoints.

The API can be accessed through the Swagger UI or programmatically from a
separate client application.
